Here is the help for the Approval module:
 
Sometimes, you might trust a user not to send unwanted content.
Maybe not enough to make them admin, but you might be ok with auto warns, blacklists, and antiflood not applying to them.

That's what approvals are for - approve of trustworthy users to allow them to send 

Admin commands:
- /approval: Check a user's approval status in this chat.

Admin commands:
- /approve: Approve of a user. Locks, blacklists, and antiflood won't apply to them anymore.
- /unapprove: Unapprove of a user. They will now be subject to locks, blacklists, and antiflood again.
- /approved: List all approved users.
- /unapproveall: Unapprove ALL users in a chat. This cannot be undone.
